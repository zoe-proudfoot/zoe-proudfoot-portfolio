    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a web developer hailing from the picturesque locale of Gisborne, New
      Zealand. Driven by a desire for career metamorphosis, I embarked on a
      transformative journey in June 2023 by enrolling in Dev Academy Aotearoa.
      This monumental decision thrust me into the captivating realm of software
      development, a world where creativity and innovation converge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I delved deeper into the multifaceted world of software development, a
      profound affection blossomed within me for the aesthetic aspects of web
      development. The artistry of CSS and the foundational structure of HTML
      became my muse, setting the stage for a passionate pursuit of web design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the Bootcamp phases of my Dev Academy Aotearoa experience, my
      horizons broadened significantly. I was exposed to a plethora of
      technologies and methodologies that form the bedrock of modern web
      development. The curriculum was meticulously crafted to equip me with the
      skills and knowledge needed to excel in this dynamic field. Key areas of
      focus included databases with SQL, the intricacies of APIs, and mastering
      the art of crafting responsive and dynamic web applications using React,
      powered by the versatile JavaScript and Typescript languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, my journey into the realm of software development through
      Dev Academy Aotearoa has not only ignited a fervent passion for web design
      but has also equipped me with a comprehensive skill set to thrive in this
      ever-evolving domain.

    <h2>What Am I Currently Working on?</h2>
    <img src="bookhive-miro.png" />
    <p>
      Envisioning a platform akin to the esteemed Goodreads, I aspire to create
      a digital haven for bibliophiles like myself. As an avid reader with an
      unwavering penchant for meticulously documenting the books I devour and
      meticulously curating a list of literary treasures awaiting exploration, I
      am fervently committed to crafting an intuitive and user-friendly website.
      This website will empower users to effortlessly compile and organize their
      personal reading lists while providing unfettered access to a wealth of
      information concerning books and the literary maestros who weave them into
      existence.
